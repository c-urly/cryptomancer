# cryptomancer
The aim of this project is to implement all possible classial ciphers.
 
<b>Curlycrypt.py</b> is module which will have all the ciphers.<br>
<b>utility.py</b> is for reusable functions (like inversemod). <br>
Functions like <b>ChiSquare</b> which can be integrated in a Statistics class which will have functions related to statistic 
calulation for breaking the ciphers.

<b>TODO</b> <br>
HILL cipher,Vigenere Cipher, substitution cipher, Index of coincidence, n-grams frequency counts, Unicity Distance, Word Statistics, Quadgram Statistics (Fitness Measure), LFSRs and the Berlekampâ€“Massey Algorithm.
